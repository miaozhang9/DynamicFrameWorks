QHNetworking is a delightful networking library for iOS and Mac OS X. It's built on top of the [Foundation URL Loading System](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/URLLoadingSystem.html), extending the powerful high-level networking abstractions built into Cocoa. It has a modular architecture with well-designed, feature-rich APIs that are a joy to use.

Perhaps the most important feature of all, however, is the amazing community of developers who use and contribute to QHNetworking every day. QHNetworking powers some of the most popular and critically-acclaimed apps on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

## Installation
QHNetworking supports multiple methods for installing the library in a project.

## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like QHNetworking in your projects. See the ["Getting Started" guide for more information](https://github.com/QHNetworking/QHNetworking/wiki/Getting-Started-with-QHNetworking). You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build QHNetworking 3.0.0+.

#### Podfile

To integrate QHNetworking into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

pod 'QHNetworking', '~> 3.0'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate QHNetworking into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "QHNetworking/QHNetworking" ~> 3.0
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `QHNetworking.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Usage

### QHURLSessionManager

`QHURLSessionManager` creates and manages an `NSURLSession` object based on a specified `NSURLSessionConfiguration` object, which conforms to `<NSURLSessionTaskDelegate>`, `<NSURLSessionDataDelegate>`, `<NSURLSessionDownloadDelegate>`, and `<NSURLSessionDelegate>`.

#### Creating a Download Task

```objective-c
NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
QHURLSessionManager *manager = [[QHURLSessionManager alloc] initWithSessionConfiguration:configuration];

NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/download.zip"];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:URL];

NSURLSessionDownloadTask *downloadTask = [manager downloadTaskWithRequest:request progress:nil destination:^NSURL *(NSURL *targetPath, NSURLResponse *response) {
    NSURL *documentsDirectoryURL = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory inDomain:NSUserDomainMask appropriateForURL:nil create:NO error:nil];
    return [documentsDirectoryURL URLByAppendingPathComponent:[response suggestedFilename]];
} completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSURL *filePath, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"File downloaded to: %@", filePath);
}];
[downloadTask resume];
```

#### Creating an Upload Task

```objective-c
NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
QHURLSessionManager *manager = [[QHURLSessionManager alloc] initWithSessionConfiguration:configuration];

NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/upload"];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:URL];

NSURL *filePath = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"file://path/to/image.png"];
NSURLSessionUploadTask *uploadTask = [manager uploadTaskWithRequest:request fromFile:filePath progress:nil completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, id responseObject, NSError *error) {
    if (error) {
        NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Success: %@ %@", response, responseObject);
    }
}];
[uploadTask resume];
```

#### Creating an Upload Task for a Multi-Part Request, with Progress

```objective-c
NSMutableURLRequest *request = [[QHHTTPRequestSerializer serializer] multipartFormRequestWithMethod:@"POST" URLString:@"http://example.com/upload" parameters:nil constructingBodyWithBlock:^(id<QHMultipartFormData> formData) {
        [formData appendPartWithFileURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"file://path/to/image.jpg"] name:@"file" fileName:@"filename.jpg" mimeType:@"image/jpeg" error:nil];
    } error:nil];

QHURLSessionManager *manager = [[QHURLSessionManager alloc] initWithSessionConfiguration:[NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration]];

NSURLSessionUploadTask *uploadTask;
uploadTask = [manager
              uploadTaskWithStreamedRequest:request
              progress:^(NSProgress * _Nonnull uploadProgress) {
                  // This is not called back on the main queue.
                  // You are responsible for dispatching to the main queue for UI updates
                  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                      //Update the progress view
                      [progressView setProgress:uploadProgress.fractionCompleted];
                  });
              }
              completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse * _Nonnull response, id  _Nullable responseObject, NSError * _Nullable error) {
                  if (error) {
                      NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);
                  } else {
                      NSLog(@"%@ %@", response, responseObject);
                  }
              }];

[uploadTask resume];
```

#### Creating a Data Task

```objective-c
NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
QHURLSessionManager *manager = [[QHURLSessionManager alloc] initWithSessionConfiguration:configuration];

NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://httpbin.org/get"];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:URL];

NSURLSessionDataTask *dataTask = [manager dataTaskWithRequest:request completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, id responseObject, NSError *error) {
    if (error) {
        NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);
    } else {
        NSLog(@"%@ %@", response, responseObject);
    }
}];
[dataTask resume];
```

### Request Serialization

Request serializers create requests from URL strings, encoding parameters as either a query string or HTTP body.

```objective-c
NSString *URLString = @"http://example.com";
NSDictionary *parameters = @{@"foo": @"bar", @"baz": @[@1, @2, @3]};
```

#### Query String Parameter Encoding

```objective-c
[[QHHTTPRequestSerializer serializer] requestWithMethod:@"GET" URLString:URLString parameters:parameters error:nil];
```

    GET http://example.com?foo=bar&baz[]=1&baz[]=2&baz[]=3

#### URL Form Parameter Encoding

```objective-c
[[QHHTTPRequestSerializer serializer] requestWithMethod:@"POST" URLString:URLString parameters:parameters error:nil];
```

    POST http://example.com/
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    foo=bar&baz[]=1&baz[]=2&baz[]=3

#### JSON Parameter Encoding

```objective-c
[[QHJSONRequestSerializer serializer] requestWithMethod:@"POST" URLString:URLString parameters:parameters error:nil];
```

    POST http://example.com/
    Content-Type: application/json

    {"foo": "bar", "baz": [1,2,3]}

### Network Reachability Manager

`QHNetworkReachabilityManager` monitors the reachability of domains, and addresses for both WWAN and WiFi network interfaces.

* Do not use Reachability to determine if the original request should be sent.
	* You should try to send it.
* You can use Reachability to determine when a request should be automatically retried.
	* Although it may still fail, a Reachability notification that the connectivity is available is a good time to retry something.
* Network reachability is a useful tool for determining why a request might have failed.
	* After a network request has failed, telling the user they're offline is better than giving them a more technical but accurate error, such as "request timed out."

See also [WWDC 2012 session 706, "Networking Best Practices."](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2012-706/).

#### Shared Network Reachability

```objective-c
[[QHNetworkReachabilityManager sharedManager] setReachabilityStatusChangeBlock:^(QHNetworkReachabilityStatus status) {
    NSLog(@"Reachability: %@", QHStringFromNetworkReachabilityStatus(status));
}];

[[QHNetworkReachabilityManager sharedManager] startMonitoring];
```

---

### Security Policy

`QHSecurityPolicy` evaluates server trust against pinned X.509 certificates and public keys over secure connections.

Adding pinned SSL certificates to your app helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and other vulnerabilities. Applications dealing with sensitive customer data or financial information are strongly encouraged to route all communication over an HTTPS connection with SSL pinning configured and enabled.

#### Allowing Invalid SSL Certificates

```objective-c
QHHTTPSessionManager *manager = [QHHTTPSessionManager manager];
manager.securityPolicy.allowInvalidCertificates = YES; // not recommended for production
```
